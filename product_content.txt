Heading:  CRISSY Salt Pre-Screening & Polymorph Screening

Paragraph: Polymorphism has become a serious concern in today’s pharmaceutical research as it affects a number of issues in pharmaceutical systems varying from processing characteristics & shelf life, to bioavailability. To reduce “surprises” and secure potential product patents, polymorph screening is considered at a very early stage in the drug discovery process. At this stage, since a large number of candidates with very small sample volumes have to be tested, only an automated system could cope with the requirements. Zinsser Analytic developed CRISSY®, an automatic workbench for salt pre-screening and polymorph screening studies.

Heading 2: DryPette® Hand Held Manual Powder Dispensing System
Paragraph:  The DryPette® is a hand held powder pipette that accurately dispenses solids, comprising a dispensing handle and a controller unit. The handles can be easily exchanged. Powder is drawn into the pipette tip in the handle under vacuum, and then expelled under light positive pressure (DryPette® Standard and Dry- Pette® Plus), or light positive pressure with or without positive displacement (DryPette® Varix range).

Sub heading: Specifiaction
List
    • Precise and reproducible
DryPette® is precise and reproducible with precision being maintained by the removal of the excess powder from the bottom of the tip after aspiration (50mg +/- 2mg; 150mg +/- 1mg; 1000mg +/- 2.5mg).
    • No Cross contamination
A rapidly exchangeable, low cost, cellulose filter is incorporated in the delivery line of the pipette, to avoid any risk of cross contamination.
    • Lightweight
The ergonomically designed hand piece allows easy and fatigue free filling of vessels. The hand piece is run from a compact control unit connected via a flexible vacuum pipe.
    • Flexible
Multiple handle sizes can be used with a single DryPette® controller unit to cover a wide dispense weight range, providing an economic, versatile powder dispensing system for your laboratory. Custom designed DryPette® nozzles and PickFix tips can also be supplied to order.
    • Simple
The pipette is simply operated via a three-position switch (fill – off – dispense) on the hand piece
