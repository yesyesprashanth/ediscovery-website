To reduce 'surprises' and secure potential product patents, polymorph screening is considered at a very early stage in the drug discovery process. At this stage, since a large number of candidates with very small sample volumes have to be tested, only an automated system could cope with the requirements. Zinsser Analytic developed CRISSY®, an automatic workbench for salt pre-screening and polymorph screening studies.",

QuAAtro39 AutoAnalyzer is now even more flexible and with 33% more capacity over its predecessor, further improving laboratory efficiency.\n\nA basic Continuous Segmented Flow Analyzer consists of an AutoSampler, a peristaltic pump, a chemistry manifold, a detector and data acquisition software. Samples and reagents are pumped continuously through the chemistry manifold. Air bubbles are introduced at regular intervals forming unique reaction segments, which are mixed using glass coils. Glass is ideal, as it is inert, stays clean and enables easy visual checks.\n\nIn Continuous Segmented Flow Analyzers reactions run to completion, and the ratio of sample to reagents in the detector reaches a constant maximum value. This results in ultra-low detection limits and exceptional reproducibility. Variations in reaction time, temperature, and sample matrix do not affect the results as they do in other colorimetric techniques, such as Flow Injection Analysis, where the reaction is not brought to completion."
